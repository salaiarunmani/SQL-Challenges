# SQL-Challenges
Hey everyone,

Here's my solution for Danny Diner Challenge brought by Danny Ma. The challenge includes the questions.

I have used MySQL workbench to solve all case study questions. I have used some essential functions like Window functions, Date functions like ADDDATE(), Last_day(), with/CTE, Joins Both Inner and Outer , case/then and sub query to solve.

Feedbacks most welcome.
